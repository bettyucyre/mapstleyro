# How to Get Unbanned on MapleStory (2025 Guide) 🍁

Getting banned from MapleStory can feel like being slammed out of Henesys with no warning. If you suspect it was a mistake or just want a second chance to hop back into Maple World, this friendly guide will show you how to appeal your ban and get back to farming those mesos and quests.

## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

Do you find yourself banned as soon as you create a new MapleStory account? Or maybe every new character you make mysteriously gets booted? That’s a classic sign of a **HWID ban** (Hardware ID Ban)! Nexon has flagged your computer hardware, which means no matter how many new accounts you make, you’re getting the cold shoulder.

## Step 1: Understand Why You Were Banned ❓

Check all emails or messages from Nexon about your MapleStory ban to understand why you got the boot. Typical ban reasons include:
- Using hacks, bots, or third-party programs  
- Toxic behavior or harassment in-game  
- Account selling, buying, or suspicious login activity  

**Pro tip:** Always review Nexon’s Terms of Service before crafting your appeal email.
