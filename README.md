<h2 id="maybe-you-are-hwid-banned-">Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️</h2>
<p>Do you find yourself banned as soon as you create a new MapleStory account? Or maybe every new character you make mysteriously gets booted? That’s a classic sign of a <strong>HWID ban</strong> (Hardware ID Ban)! Nexon has flagged your computer hardware, which means no matter how many new accounts you make, you’re getting the cold shoulder.</p>
